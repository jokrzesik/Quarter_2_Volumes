# Quarter 2 Volumes Overview - *Excel Project*
## The Data
The data for this project was downloaded off of [TMB Analytics](https://www.tmbanalytics.com/excel-for-analytics) website. The file included an Excel file with 3 sheets: sample email instructions; list of client IDs, dates, and volumes; and list of client IDs by location ID.

## Instructions
The first sheet in the file contained an email providing context for the project.
> "Hey,
> 
> The board is asking to see how volume looked in Q2. I got some data (attached), but didn’t have a chance to pull anything together and was hoping you could take a stab at it.
> 
> I think they just want to see Q2 2021 volume by region and wanted to know if everything was looking good. I think this file has what you need. I don’t remember all the region codes – I know NAM ends in 1, EMEA ends in 3 and APAC and LATAM are 2 and 4, but I don’t remember which is which. I do know LATAM has the lowest volume so just go ahead and assign that to which ever comes out lowest.

> I appreciate your help!"
